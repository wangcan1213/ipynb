However, in this case, although the observed points were correctly sorted, the expected points were incorrectly sorted by their y-coordinates because their x-coordinates were exactly the same, leading to a mistakenly returned False. In fact, even if the x-coordinates of the two expected points were not equal, as long as the coordinates of the first point were slightly less than those of the second point, the same mistake would occur.
